## My Dotti Files And the  Systems They Run On.
This repo contains dotfiles from all my linux boxes i think are worth keeping around. maybe windows too someday.
The directory `centos-vm` contains the configs of my centos 7 minimal box. No GUI, so most the things do not work
in the system. The `buntufigs` directory on the other hand holds the configs of my lubuntu with GUI config files. Most
of the things there should work for almost all GUI linux environments.

My setups include:
- Lubuntu on a 2gb ram Toshiba sattelite laptop
- Cento 7 minimal running on virtualbox (1gb ram)
- Windows 10 Enterprise on Asus x552e series (4gb ram)
- Samsung galaxy s6 edge that doubles as router and a mobile phone.

I'm mostly on my linux boxes and use the windows for school, though i don't do
much of that this days. My phone acts as router and lets me ssh between machines
without breaking a sweat. The Windows machine is very slowwwwwww, it has only
4gb of ram but runs some very resource intensive apps for school work.
I do most development work on the Lubuntu box and learn linux sysadmining skills
on the centos box.
