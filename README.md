### My Dotti Files And the  Systems They Run On.

This repo contains dotfiles from all my linux boxes i think are worth keeping around. maybe windows too someday.

My machines include
- Lubuntu on a 2gb ram Toshiba sattelite laptop
- Cento 7 minimal running on virtualbox (1gb ram)
- Windows 10 Enterprise on Asus x552e series (4gb ram)
- Samsung galaxy s6 edge that doubles as router and a mobile phone.


I'm mostly on my linux boxes and use the windows for school, though i don't do
much of that this days. My phone acts as router and lets me ssh between machines
without breaking a sweat. The Windows machine is very slowwwwwww, it has only
4gb of ram but runs some very resource intensive apps for school work.
I do most development work on the Lubuntu box and learn linux sysadmining skills
on the centos box.
