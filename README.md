## Machine Config Files
This repo contains dotfiles from all my linux boxes i think are worth keeping around. maybe windows too someday.
1. The directory `centos-vm` contains the configs of my centos 7 minimal box. No GUI, just the console.
2. The `buntufigs` directory on the other hand holds the configs of my lubuntu with GUI config files. 
3. Most of the things there should work for almost all GUI linux environments.

My setups include:
- Lubuntu on a 2gb ram Toshiba sattelite laptop
- Cento 7 minimal running on virtualbox (1gb ram)
- Windows 10 Enterprise on Asus x552e series (12gb ram)
- Samsung galaxy s6 edge that doubles as router and a mobile phone.
