# Voice Quick Reference

**Voice in one line:** One engineer talking to another over coffee.

## Good vs Bad Examples

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| SLOs without governance become stale the same way documentation does. Your payment service SLO shows 99.9% availability because someone picked that number six months ago when you had 10K daily transactions. | You inherit a service with a 99.9% availability target. Seems reasonable. Then traffic doubles. |
| The budgetingMethod: Occurrences tracks the volume of good events versus bad events (99 successful payments out of 100 attempts) rather than time-based uptime. | In today's digital landscape, occurrences-based budgeting has become essential for teams looking to leverage modern observability practices. |
| Start where you are, add what you need, and keep the system alive. | This is why your SLO journey should begin today, transforming how your team approaches reliability. |
